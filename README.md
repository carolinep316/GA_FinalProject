# GA_FinalProject

I work in single cell RNA sequencing, specifically using the 10X Single Cell product (10X is the name of the company that made the reagent kits we use). For my final project I will be using a dataset that I have used at work.

Recently we have run a validation experiment for one of our new single cell products, and I followed a Python tutorial to analyze the data.  The workflow uses clustering to groups cell types together, allowing us to identify what is what. For my project I will walk you through this tutorial; as a next step, I will take data from a different experiment and run it through similar clustering to see how this particular cell type compares to others.
