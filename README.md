# GA_FinalProject

I work in genomic science - specifically, single-cell RNA sequencing. 

A very brief summary of what this process looks like: Individual cells are isolated, the DNA within is extracted, and the DNA code is read on a sequencer. The raw data is run through a sophisticated pipeline to deconvolute the DNA sequence down to a matrix containing the gene counts within each cell. These matrices can be uploaded to Python or R for additional manual analysis.

For my final project I will be doing this following using a dataset that I have used at work.

Recently we ran a validation experiment and I followed a Python tutorial to analyze the data.  The workflow uses clustering to groups similar cells together (based on their genetic code), thereby allowing us to identify and classify different cell types within a sample. For Part I of my project I will walk you through the preliminary analysis of the experimental data. For Part II, I use new data from a different experiment and run it through Part I's clustering methods in order to compare and classify cell types.

PLEASE NOTE - I was unable to upload my raw data files to GitHub because they were too large. If you have an issue running the notebook because of this please let me know!
