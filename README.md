# GA_FinalProject

I work in single-cell RNA sequencing. In short: individual cells are isolated, DNA libraries are constructed from each cell, and the DNA code is read on a sequencer. Sophisticated pipelines help us deconvolute the raw DNA code into gene counts within each cell. 

For my final project I will be using a dataset that I have used at work.

Recently we ran a validation experiment and I followed a Python tutorial to analyze the data.  The workflow uses clustering to groups similar cells together (based on their genetic code), thereby allowing us to identify and classify different cell types within a sample. For Part I of my project I will walk you through this tutorial. For Part II I use new data from a different experiment and run it through Part I's clustering to compare this new cell type to our previously classified ones.
